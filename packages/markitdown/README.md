## ðŸ†• New Feature

### PDF Page Separators
Convert PDFs to Markdown with clear page boundaries using the `add_page_separators` parameter:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown

md = MarkItDown(enable_plugins=False)

# With page separators (new feature!)
result = md.convert("document.pdf", add_page_separators=True)
# Output includes "---" between pages

# Without page separators (default behavior)
result = md.convert("document.pdf", add_page_separators=False)
# Output is continuous text
```

## Installation

From PyPI:

```bash
pip install markitdown-pdf-separators[all]
```

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/markitdown-pdf-separators.git
cd markitdown-pdf-separators
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Command-Line

```bash
# Basic conversion

```
